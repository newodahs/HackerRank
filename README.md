# HackerRank
Solutions I wrote for HackerRank challenges.

For the most part these will be the end-solutions for any given HackerRank challenge (rather than showing each step along the way).  These snippets will only contain solutions that can be applied and not all of the original HackerRank code.

I will also try to include both a naive solution and 'optimized' solution where applicable.  I have a lot of opinions about the promotion of the 'optimized' solution as the way forward -- want to know more?  Contact me.
